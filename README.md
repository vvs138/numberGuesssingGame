This is a basic Number guessing game project based on java programming.
With a basic knowledge of If-else ladder and methods I have build this.
This is a basic project but a good logical building creator.
In this game there are 3 players who can guess the number.
If the number is correct then that player will win the game.
There is a umpire who evaluate the judge wheather the guessed number is correct or not.
