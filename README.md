# Guesser Game

This Java program implements a simple guessing game where players try to guess a number chosen by the "umpire". The umpire compares the guessed number with the numbers guessed by each player and determines the winner(s) accordingly. Players input their guesses when prompted, and the umpire announces the winner(s) or if all players have lost.
